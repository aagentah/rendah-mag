            information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify,

            COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)<br />
            When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the
            age of 13 years old, the Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
            puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States&apos;
            consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what
            operators of websites and online services must do to protect
            children&apos;s privacy and safety online.<br />
            We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.<br /><br />

            Fair Information Practices<br />
            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law
            in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant
            role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
            Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be
            implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that
            protect personal information.<br /><br />

            In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
            following responsive action, should a data breach occur:<br />
            We will notify you via email<br />
                  • Within 7 business days<br />

            We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that
            individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against
            data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
            requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data
            users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government
            agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.<br /><br />

            CAN SPAM Act<br />
            The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes
            requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have
            emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough
            penalties for violations.<br /><br />

            We collect your email address in order to:<br />
                  • Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other
                  requests or questions<br /><br />

            To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:<br />
                  • Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.<br />
                  • Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.<br />
                  • Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.<br />
                  • Monitor third-party email marketing services for
                  compliance, if one is used.<br />
                  • Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.<br />
                  • Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the
                  bottom of each email.<br /><br />

            If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can
            email us at and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.<br /><br />
